# Moisture-Minds - Predictive Soil Moisture Modeling

This project focuses on utilizing a dataset containing daily soil moisture measurements from July 2022 to March 10, 2023, at the Space Data Science Lab, IIT Dharwad. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can estimate soil moisture levels specifically for the month of March 2023.

# Problem Statement Description
The dataset provided consists of daily soil moisture measurements, along with other attribute values, recorded at the Space Data Science Lab, IIT Dharwad, from July 2022 to March 10, 2023. The task at hand is to leverage this dataset to build a model capable of predicting soil moisture levels for the month of March 2023. By analyzing the historical data, the model will be able to generate predictions that can assist in understanding soil moisture patterns and facilitate decision-making in areas such as agriculture, natural disaster management, and climate modeling.

# Data
The dataset includes the following information for each data point:

* Date: The specific date of the measurement.
* Soil Moisture: The recorded soil moisture level for that date.
* Other Attributes: Additional attribute values that may be available alongside the soil moisture measurement.

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
* Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Set up the necessary environment variables: (List any specific environment variables if applicable)

# Results

* Root Mean Square Error : 243.76 and 388.20 on two bifurcated models respectively.
* This model is part of a Hackathon called Moisture Minds PARSEC'23 by IIT Dharwad.
* This landed out team 9th rank among 416 registrations.
